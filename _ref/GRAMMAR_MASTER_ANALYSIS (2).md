3. Layout no longer forces immediate login
4. External link health checking prevents broken redirects
5. API route checks anonymous trial first, then account trial

### ⚠️ Hybrid Components

2. **`ensureTrialForApp.ts`** - Used for account-based trial (after anonymous expires)
   - Currently set to 10 minutes (TEST mode)
   - Should be changed to 3 days for production

### ❌ Old System (Not Used by Grammar Master)

   - Still used by Cast Master
   - NOT used by Grammar Master anymore
2. **`checkUserAccess()` in `src/lib/access.ts`** - Checks `trialStartedAt` field
   - Still used by Cast Master
   - NOT used by Grammar Master anymore

### 🟡 Separate Trial System
1. **`/api/me/products` trial system** - Different from Grammar Master's anonymous trial
   - Used by landing page product cards

## 🔧 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Keep (NEW System)
- ✅ All anonymous trial components and APIs
- ✅ `AnonymousTrialGuard` usage in Grammar Master page
- ✅ External link health checking
- ✅ Current layout (no forced login)

### Update (HYBRID)
- ⚠️ Change `ensureTrialForApp.ts` trial duration from 10 minutes to 3 days
- ⚠️ Consider renaming to clarify it's for "account trial" not "anonymous trial"

### Remove or Deprecate (OLD System)
- ❌ `TrialGuard` component (if Cast Master also moves to new system)
- ❌ `checkUserAccess()` in `src/lib/access.ts` (if not used by other products)
- ❌ `user.trialStartedAt` field (if moving fully to productGrants-based trials)

### Clarify (NEUTRAL)
- 🟡 Document that `/api/me/products` is a DIFFERENT trial system
- 🟡 Consider consolidating trial systems in the future
